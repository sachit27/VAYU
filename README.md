# VAYU

Vayu a Python (>3.7) based desktop application using the PyQt5 library for data processing, visualization and analysis. The toolbox was developed with the aim to equip experts as well as non-experts to process, analyse and visualize sensor data.

## Tutorials
A tutorial is available at the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/sachit27/VAYU/wiki). It provides an easy to follow step by step guide that shows different features of the toolbox as well as the outputs received after implementation of those functions.

## Issues
If there are any issues/bugs, please  report them using the GitHub issue functionality.

## Getting Started
The main application file is availabel in the [src](https://github.com/sachit27/VAYU/tree/main/src) folder. The current version works well for MacOS as well as Windows.

## Example Dataset
The [dataset](https://github.com/sachit27/VAYU/tree/main/dataset) folder includes several datasets that have been used for testing the toolbox. The example datasets include data from AirBox sensors, PurpleAir and two custom datasets. The reason behind having custom datasets was to test the toolbox with data in different formats. More datasets are being tested currently that include data from Luftdaten sensors. 

### Source Code
To run the application, download the app.py file. You can use the terminal in mac or the command line tool in windows to start the application. It is advisable to create a virtual environment to work with this application.

To start Vayu

            python 3 app.py
            
Note: All the outputs (data files, figures and plots ) would be saved in the folder where the main python file is stored.
